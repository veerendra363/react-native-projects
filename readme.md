# Meals Project

## Project Overview

The Meals project is a static React Native application that provides users with a collection of meals and recipes. It offers a simple and intuitive interface for exploring different meal categories, viewing meals within each category, and accessing detailed information about specific meals.

## Features

- **Meal Listing:** Within each category, users can view a list of meals associated with that category. Each meal is represented by a name and brief description.

- **Meal Details:** Upon selecting a meal, users are presented with detailed information about the selected meal. This includes the list of ingredients and step-by-step instructions to prepare the meal.

- **Favorites:** Users have the option to mark meals as favorites, allowing them to easily access and reference their preferred recipes.
