# First React Native APP



## Getting started
- we must have idea on react before starting the react native.
- react native is used to develop the android and ios apps in one go.
- react native converts the code ui code from js to native platform code and js logic will be run using js thread which was hosted by react native(in the app)
- we can use expo cli and reactive native cli for development. we will use expo cli because its easy and fast.
- if we have react and node already installed in our machine then just run the `npx create-expo-app AwesomeProject` which will create the react native project.
- by using expo we can run the app in our phone or simulators(android studio and xcode)
- run the app using `npm start`
  - just install expo go app in our phone and scan the QR from expo go app.
  - open android or ios simulator and press a to run android app or press i to run ios app.
