# Guess the Number

This is a small game application where the user enters a number between 1 and 99. The app then randomly generates a number within that range and starts guessing the number. After each guess, the user tells the app whether the guessed number was too high, too low, or correct. The app then narrows its range of guesses based on the user's input. The game ends when the app correctly guesses the number.

This Game is looks better in portrait mode than landscape but we can play the game in both orientation.
